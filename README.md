# Ridgecrest_Optical_Data
This repo. contains 3D optical image correlation results for the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence using the COSI-Corr+ technique

Displacement maps are produced using WorldView 1-3 and SPOT6 imagery. 

The Slip_data_Milliner.txt file contains the slip vectors measured from the optical displacement maps used to invert for the stress state outlined in Milliner et al. (2022)

Use of these data should reference the following:
